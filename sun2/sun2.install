To install CLU on a Sun2 the following must be done:

1) Move ~CLU/sun2/exe/link to ~CLU/exe.

2) Move ~CLU/sun2/bin/* to ~CLU/bin.

5) Build and install a new clu, asm, ted, and any other
   of the files in ~CLU/exe that don't seem to work.
   See ~CLU/howto.cons to find out how to do this.

6) Build a new basesys and basesys.dump.
