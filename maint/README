The scripts in this directory were used to update the copyrights on the
clu files.  The ownership of the copyright was changed from Liskov to
MIT; the current year was added; files citing an author were not put
under copyright.

These scripts may or may not be useful in the future.  There *are* some
useful shell syntactic structures within them.

checkatt - checks whether a file has an author or not
owned    - is the last output of checkatt grepped for 'ATT'

checker  - looks for copyrights
checker.list - might exist and contain output from checker

asmhead  - copyright for asm files
cluhead  - copyright for clu files

fixasm   - prepends asmhead onto files in asmadds
		maintains a saved copy
		wants input to continue for each file
fixclu	 - prepends cluhead onto files in cluadds

fixcopy  - might be useful

inspect  - somewhat useful

mute	 - mutates a Liskov copyright to an MIT copyright on files in mutlist
mute.prog-	used by mute: may not be quite right cf refix

recap    - reinspects mutlist files, griping if Liskov exists in file

refix	 - remunged the order of years (?) cf ?bad mute.prog


%%%%
sometimes the copyright is not aesthetically placed
