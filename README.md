# CLU #
is a programming language created at MIT by Barbara Liskov and her students between 1974 and 1975.


**Origin**

I found this source while following a tangent that started [here](http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/CLU.html) and lead me to [here](http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/~dcurtis/clu/) (404)



**License ?**

Most source files are marked with "Copyright Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1980, 1989".
My first TODO is try and see if anyone listed in this source can be contacted, and to set the correct licensing (if any) for this source. Pending that outcome I have lsited this source as MIT.
